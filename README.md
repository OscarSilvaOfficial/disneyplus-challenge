# Disney Plus API Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the Disney Plus API Challenge! In this challenge, you will design and implement a scalable API for a streaming platform similar to Disney Plus. Your API should handle user authentication, content management, media streaming, subscription management, and more.

This challenge is designed to assess your ability to create a well-architected, secure, and efficient backend system. Good luck!

## Challenge Requirements

### 1. User Authentication
- Implement secure user registration, login, and logout functionality.
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.
- Include endpoints to retrieve and update user profile information.
- Passwords should be securely hashed.

### 2. Content Management
- Design models to handle different types of content (e.g., movies, TV shows, episodes).
- Support categories, genres, and metadata (e.g., title, description, release date, duration).
- Implement API endpoints to:
  - Retrieve lists of content based on filters (genre, release date, popularity).
  - Retrieve detailed information about specific content.
  - Create, update, and delete content (admin functionality).

### 3. Media Streaming
- Design an architecture that supports video streaming.
- Implement a mock endpoint that simulates video streaming by returning a URL or stream key.
- Ensure that the API can handle large-scale content delivery efficiently.

### 4. Subscription Management
- Design a system to handle subscription plans (e.g., basic, premium).
- Implement API endpoints to:
  - Manage user subscriptions (create, update, cancel).
  - Integrate with a payment gateway (use Stripe or a mock service).
  
### 5. Content Recommendation System
- Implement a basic recommendation engine that suggests content based on user behavior (e.g., watch history, liked content).
- Provide an endpoint to retrieve personalized content recommendations.

### 6. Logging and Monitoring
- Implement logging for critical events (e.g., user login, content streaming).
- Set up basic monitoring to track API performance and usage statistics.

### 7. Rate Limiting and Security
- Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse.
- Secure endpoints using proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Ensure input validation to prevent common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

### 8. Documentation
- Provide comprehensive API documentation using Swagger or a similar tool.
- Include details on endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express/NestJS or Python with Django/Flask.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user and content data.
- **Authentication**: JWT for stateless session management.
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe or a similar payment service for subscription management.
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration.
- **Cloud Services**: AWS/GCP/Azure for hosting and content delivery (e.g., S3/GCS for storing media).

## Bonus Points

- Implement GraphQL alongside RESTful endpoints.
- Integrate a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
- Use a microservices architecture for different modules (e.g., user service, content service).
- Optimize API performance with caching strategies (e.g., Redis).
- Add a real-time feature like chat or comments using WebSockets.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Architecture**: Quality of the API design, including scalability, maintainability, and modularity.
- **Code Quality**: Adherence to best practices, code readability, and structure.
- **Security**: Implementation of security best practices to protect user data and content.
- **Performance**: API efficiency in handling requests and data processing.
- **Documentation**: Clarity and completeness of the API documentation.
- **Innovation**: Creative solutions or additional features beyond the basic requirements.
